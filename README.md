ML Treatment of the Annual Survey on Construction Enterprises Using Administrative Data

Each year, a Survey on Construction Enterprises is conducted to gather critical industry insights. The responses collected are used to build a stratification model, enabling estimations beyond the sampled businesses. However, for this methodology to be effective, all variables used in the stratum definition must be complete—yet some remain missing. This introduces challenges related to non-response and partial non-response, which must be properly addressed to ensure data quality and reliable analysis.

To mitigate these gaps, a valuable administrative data source can be leveraged: the Simplified Business Information (IES), collected by the Tax Administration. Unlike survey-based data collection, IES is a census-based system that undergoes rigorous validation through the NSI’s Integrated Business Account System (SCIE). SCIE consolidates enterprise-level data, contributing to a broader understanding of sectoral growth and economic trends.

This administrative dataset provides essential business characteristics, including geographical classification based on the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), economic activity sector categorized by the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE), as well as financial indicators such as turnover and employment figures. Beyond general business attributes, IES also includes construction-specific financial data, such as expenditures on building materials, costs associated with building construction, and investments in infrastructure-related projects.

The current study explores how machine learning (ML) models can assist in estimating missing stratification variables, improving data completeness and reliability. Through extensive data exploration, valuable insights are gained in profiling construction enterprises, enabling a deeper understanding of industry dynamics. In particular, we introduce derived variables that capture interactions between NACE classifications and turnover, as well as key distinctions between the two types of existing questionnaires. These questionnaires are specifically designed for larger enterprises (Type A) and smaller enterprises (Type B), based on their number of employees.

Beyond evaluating the accuracy of ML predictions against ground truth responses, this study also compares them with answers provided by enterprises in previous years—specifically from the prior period (n-1) or even earlier (n-2). This temporal comparison introduces an additional layer of validation, leveraging an enterprise’s historical responses as a form of "memory." By integrating survey data with administrative sources, we enhance data completeness, reduce response burden, and ultimately improve the accuracy of estimations.
